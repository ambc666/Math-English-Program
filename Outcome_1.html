    //SQA Introduction to Developing Software
    //This is a program that has 2 departments, English and Maths.  The program will run and ask for a name which it uses to welcome the user and has a prompt box to run the program.  The English department will ask to enter a number and it will give a corresponding letter for the number entered.  The maths program asks for 2 numbers which is adds together to give a total.  The user is given a third option to be able to exit the program.
